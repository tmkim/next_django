django1 -> DRF Tutorial
    Good understanding of how DRF manages API backend.
    Mostly used models.py, serializers.py, views.py, urls.py
    + settings.py, permissions.py

    Questions:
    - Why hyperlink? Why not hyperlink?
    - Why view vs viewset vs router? (I think it basically depends on how much control you want over data)
    - How to connect to front-end? Nextjs?
        I think there's a hint to this with the Highlighted view?
        Potentially need separate url path for api + frontend
